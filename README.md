# NETWORKSCANNER

This is a simple network scanner program written in Python. It uses the tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface and the ipaddress and subprocess modules for network scanning.

## Installation

You can simply download the `networkscanner.pyw` file and run it using a Python interpreter.

## Usage

1. Enter the network address in the `NETWORK ADDRESS` field. The format should be something like `192.168.0.0/24`.

2. Click the `SCAN` button to start the scanning process.

3. The program will scan all the IP addresses in the network range and display the online hosts in the console output.

4. A file named `NETWORKSCANNER-RESULTS.txt` will be created in the same directory as the program with a list of online hosts.
